We are building a system which will allow bird watchers to type in certain keywords, and based on the input the system will suggest potential matches for the birds. 

The main categories of keywords are
colors: 
black
brown
rufus
yellow

habitat:
water
arboreal
arial

type:
predator
sunbird
waterfowl

The user typically invokes the program with one or more keywords. Based on the mmatches the program will suggest the following
A list of potential birds being described by the user
An error messages saying that the keyword is not valid
A message saying that there is no bird which has all the following characteristics

The user can put in one or more keywords, but not more than 3 because there are only three main categories.
